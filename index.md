:wave: Hi, this is Fangzhou. I am particularly interested in optimization and learning for control of highly dynamic robots, and cooking. Currently, I am an Applied Scientist at the Boston Dynamics AI Institute.

I graduated from Oregon State University with a M.S in Robotics, where I worked on RL and trajectory optimization for Cassie and Digit. Prior to that, I was a pastry cook in NYC at [Pecking House](https://www.peckinghouse.com/). I did my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University.
