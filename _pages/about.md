:wave: Hi, this is Fangzhou. I am particularly interested in optimization and learning for control of highly dynamic robots. Currently, I am an Applied Scientist at the Boston Dynamics AI Institute.

I graduated from Oregon State University with a M.S in Robotics, where I worked on RL and trajectory optimization for Cassie and Digit. Prior to that, I did my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Stony Brook University.
